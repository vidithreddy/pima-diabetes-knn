# Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset - EDA and k-NN Classification (pima-diabetes-knn)

## Purpose and Motivation
This project demonstrates a professional approach to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and supervised learning using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The goal is to understand data quality, visualize relationships between features and the target variable, and train a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier with cross-validation to select the best hyperparameter.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- Medical diagnostic dataset with patient health data to predict the onset of diabetes.

## Features Demonstrated
- Data loading and cleaning with pandas
- Statistical summaries and correlation analysis
- Visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib
- Train-test split and cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning for k-NN
- Model training and test evaluation

## Real-World Use Case
This analysis mirrors a typical data science workflow for healthcare analytics. Understanding the factors that contribute to diabetes risk and building interpretable models can help inform clinical decision-making and early intervention strategies.
